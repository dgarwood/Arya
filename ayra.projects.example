# Special project name is "windowTitlesToIgnore" it is a set of REs
# that if match window title will cause the plugin to ignore that
# window change and stay with the old project. This was introduced
# because of modal windows, i.e. windows that open within some other
# main window. For example, when in Firefox you want to save a file
# modal window opens. This window has its own title, but plugin
# shoudn't change the current project.
