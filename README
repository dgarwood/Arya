Arya: Automatic Recorder of Your Activities

Arya is a simple Gnome 3 Shell extension that adds up how much time you spend
using each of your applications. It's not very fully featured yet, but in the
future it will hopefully be a useful extension.

Planned Features (I hope):
* Pretty graphs to show app usage over time
* Activity level monitoring to suggest when you should take a break
