Arya: Automatic Recorder of Your Activities

Arya is a simple Gnome 3 Shell extension that adds up how much time you spend
using each of your applications. It's not very fully featured yet, but in the
future it will hopefully be a useful extension.

Planned Features (I hope):
* Pretty graphs to show app usage over time
* Activity level monitoring to suggest when you should take a break

Install Instructions:

0. git clone git@github.com:jcrussell/Arya.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/arya@jcrussell.github.com
1. Restart gnome-shell: ALT+F2, then enter "r" without quotes or log out and back in
